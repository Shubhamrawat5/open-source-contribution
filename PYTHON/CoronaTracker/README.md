# Covid-Tracker
## Overview

This is a Python project that prvides us the Active, Dead and Discharge cases of COVID-19 from the website of MoHFW. The script scrapes the Ministry's website and gives us the needed real time information. I have used BeautifulSoup package to perform the actual web-scraping.
